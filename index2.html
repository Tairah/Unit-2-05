<blockquote cite="http://www.myislam.org/who/index.html">
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Do not worship except Allah and to parents do good and to 
relatives, orphans, and the needy.Speak to people good 
words and establish prayer and give zakah. Then you 
turned away, except a few of you, and you were refusing.
"Surah Baqarah Ayat 83".</p>
